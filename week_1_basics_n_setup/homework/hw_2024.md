## Module 1 Homework

## Docker & SQL

In this homework we'll prepare the environment 
and practice with Docker and SQL


## Question 1. Knowing docker tags

Run the command to get information on Docker 

```docker --help```

Now run the command to get help on the "docker build" command:

```docker build --help```

Do the same for "docker run".

Which tag has the following text? - *Automatically remove the container when it exits* 

- `--delete`
- `--rc`
- `--rmc`
- `--rm`

### Command:
```sh
docker run --help
```

### Answer:
```
--rm
```

## Question 2. Understanding docker first run 

Run docker with the python:3.9 image in an interactive mode and the entrypoint of bash.
Now check the python modules that are installed ( use ```pip list``` ). 

What is version of the package *wheel* ?

- 0.42.0
- 1.0.0
- 23.0.1
- 58.1.0

### Command:
```sh
docker run -it python:3.9 bash
root@9d3d0c536645:/# pip list
```

### Answer:
```
0.42.0
```

# Prepare Postgres

Run Postgres and load data as shown in the videos
We'll use the green taxi trips from September 2019:

```wget https://github.com/DataTalksClub/nyc-tlc-data/releases/download/green/green_tripdata_2019-09.csv.gz```

You will also need the dataset with zones:

```wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/nyc-tlc/misc/taxi+_zone_lookup.csv```

Download this data and put it into Postgres (with jupyter notebooks or with a pipeline)

I use Script to load data to Postgres,
command:
```
# -----------------------------
# -- run Postgres
# -----------------------------
docker compose up -d

# -----------------------------
# -- pgcli
# -----------------------------
pgcli -h localhost -p 5432 -u root -d ny_taxi

# -----------------------------
# -- ingest data
# -----------------------------
docker build -t taxi_ingest:v001 .

URL="https://github.com/DataTalksClub/nyc-tlc-data/releases/download/green/green_tripdata_2019-09.csv.gz"
docker run -it \ 
  --network=2_docker_sql_pg-network \
  taxi_ingest:v001 \
  --user=root \
  --password=root \
  --host=pgdatabase \
  --port=5432 \
  --db=ny_taxi \
  --table_name=green_taxi_trips \
  --url=${URL}

URL="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nyc-tlc/misc/taxi+_zone_lookup.csv"
docker run -it \ 
  --network=2_docker_sql_pg-network \
  taxi_ingest:v001 \
  --user=root \
  --password=root \
  --host=pgdatabase \
  --port=5432 \
  --db=ny_taxi \
  --table_name=zones \
  --url=${URL}
```

## Question 3. Count records 

How many taxi trips were totally made on September 18th 2019?

Tip: started and finished on 2019-09-18. 

Remember that `lpep_pickup_datetime` and `lpep_dropoff_datetime` columns are in the format timestamp (date and hour+min+sec) and not in date.

- 15767
- 15612
- 15859
- 89009

### Command:
```sh
SELECT count(1) 
FROM green_taxi_trips 
WHERE DATE_TRUNC('day', lpep_dropoff_datetime) = '2019-09-18' AND DATE_TRUNC('day', lpep_pickup_datetime) = '2019-09-18';
```

### Answer:
```
15612
```

## Question 4. Largest trip for each day

Which was the pick up day with the largest trip distance
Use the pick up time for your calculations.

- 2019-09-18
- 2019-09-16
- 2019-09-26
- 2019-09-21

### Command:
```sh
SELECT lpep_pickup_datetime, trip_distance 
FROM green_taxi_trips 
ORDER BY trip_distance DESC 
LIMIT 1;
```

### Answer:
```
2019-09-26
```

## Question 5. Three biggest pick up Boroughs

Consider lpep_pickup_datetime in '2019-09-18' and ignoring Borough has Unknown

Which were the 3 pick up Boroughs that had a sum of total_amount superior to 50000?
 
- "Brooklyn" "Manhattan" "Queens"
- "Bronx" "Brooklyn" "Manhattan"
- "Bronx" "Manhattan" "Queens" 
- "Brooklyn" "Queens" "Staten Island"

### Command:
```sh
SELECT sum(t.total_amount) as sum_amount, lpu."Borough"
FROM green_taxi_trips t
RIGHT JOIN zones lpu ON lpu."LocationID" = t."PULocationID"
WHERE DATE_TRUNC('day', lpep_pickup_datetime) = '2019-09-18'
GROUP BY lpu."Borough"
HAVING sum(t.total_amount) > 50000
ORDER BY sum(t.total_amount) DESC;
```

### Answer:
```
"Bronx" "Manhattan" "Queens"
```

## Question 6. Largest tip

For the passengers picked up in September 2019 in the zone name Astoria which was the drop off zone that had the largest tip?
We want the name of the zone, not the id.

Note: it's not a typo, it's `tip` , not `trip`

- Central Park
- Jamaica
- JFK Airport
- Long Island City/Queens Plaza

### Command:
```sh
SELECT ldo."Zone" AS drop_off_zone, max(t.tip_amount) as max_tip
FROM green_taxi_trips t
JOIN zones lpu ON lpu."LocationID" = t."PULocationID"
JOIN zones ldo ON ldo."LocationID" = t."DOLocationID"
WHERE DATE_TRUNC('day', lpep_pickup_datetime) between '2019-09-01' and '2019-09-30'
  AND lpu."Zone" = 'Astoria'
group by drop_off_zone ORDER BY max_tip DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

### Answer:
```
JFK Airport
```


## Terraform

In this section homework we'll prepare the environment by creating resources in GCP with Terraform.

In your VM on GCP/Laptop/GitHub Codespace install Terraform. 
Copy the files from the course repo
[here](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/tree/main/01-docker-terraform/1_terraform_gcp/terraform) to your VM/Laptop/GitHub Codespace.

Modify the files as necessary to create a GCP Bucket and Big Query Dataset.


## Question 7. Creating Resources

After updating the main.tf and variable.tf files run:

```
terraform apply
```

Paste the output of this command into the homework submission form.

### Answer:
```
var.project
  Your GCP Project ID

  Enter a value: <omitted>


Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # google_bigquery_dataset.dataset will be created
  + resource "google_bigquery_dataset" "dataset" {
      + creation_time              = (known after apply)

Plan: 2 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

Do you want to perform these actions?
  Terraform will perform the actions described above.
  Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.

  Enter a value: yes

google_bigquery_dataset.dataset: Creating...
google_storage_bucket.data-lake-bucket: Creating...
google_bigquery_dataset.dataset: Creation complete after 2s [id=projects/<omitted>/datasets/trips_data_all]
google_storage_bucket.data-lake-bucket: Creation complete after 2s [id=dtc_data_lake_<omitted>]

Apply complete! Resources: 2 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
