## Week 1 Homework

In this homework we'll prepare the environment by creating resources in GCP with Terraform.

In your VM on GCP install Terraform. Copy the files from the course repo
[here](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/tree/main/week_1_basics_n_setup/1_terraform_gcp/terraform) to your VM.

Modify the files as necessary to create a GCP Bucket and Big Query Dataset.


## Question 1. Creating Resources

After updating the main.tf and variable.tf files run:

```
terraform apply
```

Paste the output of this command into the homework submission form.

### Answer:
```
var.project
  Your GCP Project ID

  Enter a value: <omitted>


Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # google_bigquery_dataset.dataset will be created
  + resource "google_bigquery_dataset" "dataset" {
      + creation_time              = (known after apply)
      + dataset_id                 = "trips_data_all"
      + delete_contents_on_destroy = false
      + etag                       = (known after apply)
      + id                         = (known after apply)
      + last_modified_time         = (known after apply)
      + location                   = "us-west1"
      + project                    = "<omitted>"
      + self_link                  = (known after apply)

                  + project_id = (known after apply)
                }
            }

          + routine {
              + dataset_id = (known after apply)
              + project_id = (known after apply)
              + routine_id = (known after apply)
            }

          + view {
              + dataset_id = (known after apply)
              + project_id = (known after apply)
              + table_id   = (known after apply)
            }
        }
    }

  # google_storage_bucket.data-lake-bucket will be created
  + resource "google_storage_bucket" "data-lake-bucket" {
      + force_destroy               = true
      + id                          = (known after apply)
      + location                    = "US-WEST1"
      + name                        = "dtc_data_lake_<omitted>"
      + project                     = (known after apply)

      + self_link                   = (known after apply)
      + storage_class               = "STANDARD"
      + uniform_bucket_level_access = true
      + url                         = (known after apply)

      + lifecycle_rule {
          + action {
              + type = "Delete"
            }

          + condition {
              + age                   = 30
              + matches_prefix        = []
              + matches_storage_class = []
              + matches_suffix        = []
              + with_state            = (known after apply)
            }
        }

      + versioning {
          + enabled = true
        }

      + website {
          + main_page_suffix = (known after apply)
          + not_found_page   = (known after apply)
        }
    }

Plan: 2 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

Do you want to perform these actions?
  Terraform will perform the actions described above.
  Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.

  Enter a value: yes

google_bigquery_dataset.dataset: Creating...
google_storage_bucket.data-lake-bucket: Creating...
google_bigquery_dataset.dataset: Creation complete after 2s [id=projects/<omitted>/datasets/trips_data_all]
google_storage_bucket.data-lake-bucket: Creation complete after 2s [id=dtc_data_lake_<omitted>]

Apply complete! Resources: 2 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
```
